# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.

### `About our Project`

This would be our second project completed while at Flatiron School. We imagined one of the most popular websites today and that would be the Astronomy Picture of the Day provided by Nasa and pictures submitted by individual people. We created an App that merges the data so that users are able to view the entire month worth of photos and get the information from each one of them by clicking on the photo they find the most interesting. If looking at the entire months photos is a bit intimidating we allowed the user to view weekly or daily through routes we provided. Finally, the last route we provided was a photo that the user is able to submit to their own local machine. The photo that the user sumbits has the same functionality as the other photos pulled from the Nasa website. 

### `Stretch Goals`
We would have liked to create some pagenation for our project and to be able to shift through more months. With little knowledge on how to accomplish these goals. We hard-coded the month of September 2021 which was how we were able to get these photos. In the future, both my project partner and I would like to reserach more into how we are able to create pagenation and not hard code dates and more go through dates that the user inputs.

### `Conclusion`
This project was done with about 6 weeks of learning Javascript and React. We hope this project could be used for other students or Flatiron associates. Additonally, this project was made to show our knowledge of React and JavaScript. Thank you for taking the time to Read the README.md.
